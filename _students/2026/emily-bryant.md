bio: "My work explores a simplistic style that brings child-like wonder to the viewers imagination. With a simplistic style, it's easy on the eyes and easy to understand. My work focuses on bringing ideas to life with child-like wonder and delight. I hope to one day inspire someone else to see the world with this kind of wonder, too."
